**Unlock Insights from Complex EU Energy Policy with Generative AI**

SmartPolicyAssistant is an advanced AI-powered tool designed to tackle the challenge of analyzing, summarizing, and comparing dense European Union National Energy & Climate Plans (NECPs). Leveraging cutting-edge Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques with Google's Gemini models, this project provides a streamlined way to extract structured information and generate accurate, context-aware answers grounded in source documents.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed.
*   [Conda (or Miniconda)](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) installed.
*   Access to Google Generative AI (Gemini API) and an API Key.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Kianjn/SmartPolicyAssistant.git
    cd SmartPolicyAssistant
    ```

2.  **Create & Activate Conda Environment:**
    ```bash
    conda create --name policy_env python=3.10 -y
    conda activate policy_env
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    *(Consider creating a `requirements.txt` file (`pip freeze > requirements.txt`) and using `pip install -r requirements.txt`)*
    ```bash
    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install langchain langchain-google-genai google-generativeai langchain-community python-dotenv streamlit pandas PyPDF2 # Added PyPDF2 assuming PDF processing
    # Add any other specific dependencies here
    ```

4.  **Configure Google API Key:**
    Create a `.env` file in the project's root directory:
    ```bash
    echo "GOOGLE_API_KEY=YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY_HERE" > .env
    ```
    Replace `YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual key.

5.  **Prepare Data:**
    *   Place your source NECP documents (e.g., PDFs) into the `data/input/` directory.
    *   Run the necessary preprocessing scripts located in `src/preprocessing/` to convert, clean, and potentially structure the data. (You might need to add specific instructions here depending on your scripts).
    *   Processed data required for the Q&A system should reside in `data/processed/`.

## üí¨ Usage

### Option 1: Interactive Web Interface (Recommended)

1.  Navigate to the UI directory:
    ```bash
    cd src/ui
    ```
2.  Launch the Streamlit application:
    ```bash
    streamlit run ui_chat.py
    ```
3.  Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8501` (or the URL provided by Streamlit).

### Option 2: Command Line Interface (for testing/scripting)

1.  Navigate to the indexing logic directory:
    ```bash
    cd src/indexing
    ```
2.  Run the Q&A script (this might require specific arguments depending on `policy_qa.py`'s implementation):
    ```bash
    python policy_qa.py --query "Your question here"
    # Or run interactively if the script supports it
    python policy_qa.py
    ```

### Example Questions

*   "What is Germany's target for renewable energy share in gross final consumption for 2030?"
*   "Compare the planned reduction in greenhouse gas emissions for France and Spain by 2030 relative to 1990 levels."
*   "Summarize Austria's strategy for improving energy efficiency in the building sector."
*   "Which countries explicitly mention targets for offshore wind capacity expansion by 2030?"
*   "List the primary policy measures mentioned by Italy to support renewable energy deployment."

## üîÆ Future Roadmap & Potential Enhancements

*   **Enhanced Data Extraction:** Implement more robust NLP techniques (e.g., NER, relation extraction) for finer-grained structured data capture from PDFs/text.
*   **Advanced Query Decomposition:** Break down complex multi-part questions for more accurate retrieval and synthesis.
*   **Interactive Visualization:** Integrate plotting libraries (e.g., Plotly, Altair) within Streamlit to visualize comparative data.
*   **Multi-lingual Support:** Fine-tune or adapt models to handle queries and potentially documents in multiple EU languages.
*   **Scalability & Performance:** Optimize data loading, indexing (e.g., using vector databases like ChromaDB or FAISS), and API calls for larger datasets.
*   **Formal Evaluation Framework:** Develop metrics (e.g., RAGAS, BLEU, ROUGE, factual consistency checks) to quantitatively assess response quality.
*   **Real-time Data Integration:** Build pipelines to automatically fetch, process, and incorporate updated NECP documents or related policy news.
*   **User Feedback Loop:** Implement mechanisms for users to rate answer quality, helping to refine the system.
